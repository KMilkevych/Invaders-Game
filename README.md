# Invaders Game
Cool shooting game in similar style to space invaders.
## Ambition
The idea behind this project was to make a simple clone of the popular arcade game Space Invaders,
however the scope for the project grew, and now it features the following:
- Four different types of enemy ships.
- Randomly generated stages (levels).
- A shop featuring purchasable upgrades to your ship, big bullets (timed bombs) and extra lives.
- A cool level selection screen.
## Controls
The controls are very simple:
- Arrow keys to move left and right.
- Up arrow to shoot.
- Z to shoot big bullet (if in possession of any).
- Z to detonate big bullet (if any have been shot).
- 1, 2 or 3 to activate different cheats (followed by q and w to add/remove life points, if cheat 3 has been activated).
- ENTER to skip loading transitions at beginning and end of stage.
- Mouse to select stages and items in shop.
## Dependencies
- PyGame
- Python 3.6
- Sprites in the "sprites" folder
